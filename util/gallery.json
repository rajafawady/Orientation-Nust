At present, 35+ societies are working in NUST, with a majority being open to students of all schools. These are student-run societies and receive funding from either external sponsors or the Main Office. These societies will have stalls up and you will be shown an introductory message of all societies and their workings during Orientation and while they may seem too many in number to remember and keep count and may either excite or even overwhelm you, it is important to know what you want to do. Societies are a way of grooming yourself, your personality, and your skills, all the while making new friends and lots of good memories. Some well-known societies include NUST Community Service Club (NCSC), NUST Debating Society (NDS), NUST Trekking Club (NTC), NUST Dramatics Club (NDC), and NUST Media Club (NMC). Applications for executives generally start after a couple of weeks of the induction of the freshmen batch. There are multiple portfolios in each society and inside each portfolio, the hierarchy followed is: Executives -> Deputy Director(s) -> Director. When filling the forms, be sure to be truthful but confident and give the interview with even greater confidence. Societies are not only a way of personal and professional grooming, but also a way of networking. So be open and nice to all and make new friends! Choose whichever portfolio interests you the most and apply away!"

With the campus being closed and shifting to online mode for almost a year and a half, university life is back to full zeal and zest and everyone is buzzing with excitement and ideas. Multiple societies and schools arrange different types of events, with different scales and thus it is good to keep an eye open. Some common types of social events are hiking trips to any northern area. These include night stay trips too. Other events include bake sales and movie screenings, scavenger hunts, global villages, and sports galas, concerts, raves, and talks and activities. Each comes with a ticket price ranging from Rs. 100 – Rs. 2500. It is important that you go to these events and make new friends and memories.

In addition to this, long and dreary lectures can also make us hungry, just to have an excuse to get through the class. With the huge and gorgeous campus, you walk around a lot and want to spend time with friends and be social and just have a good time. The words friends and fun go hand-in-hand with food and NUST makes sure you have no fewer food options. With the 4 main cafeterias and the 4 other fancy-dhaba-style cafes, which are student-run, food options are plenty. Starting with the main cafeterias, Concordia 1 (C1) and Concordia 2 (C2). These are proper big circular structures with everything from food shops to stationery and tuck shops. Both these cafeterias offer a variety of food items ranging from sandwiches and fries to chana daal and biryani. Some of the more loved items are Samosa Chaat and Biryani from C1, Roll parathas from C2. Fries are best left to café in C2 or Margalla café, opposite SADA Parking. C1 is generally crowded with students of SADA, ASAB, NBS, and SCME whereas C2 is comparatively less crowded, with students of SEECS and other schools mostly going there. Concordia 3 (C3), right opposite to Library, and Concordia 4 (C4), in SMME, are famous for their desi breakfast and biryani and orange juice in winter. C3 is generally alive at night, with the lights on and the pretty view of the sports complex. C4 is mostly limited to students of SNS and SMME, who are closest to it and farthest from all other cafes. Another option is the NICE rooftop café, famous for its shawarmas. Coming to the student-run cafes, the two open these days are Margalla, opposite SADA parking, and Retro, near the Boy’s hostels. With the other two cafes closed, Margalla is the life of NUST, and their food is equally so. Everything on their menu, from the fries to the pizza, everything is of great taste and quality, with the cheesy pasta being a student favorite. The first semester after coming to NUST is just exploring, do not hesitate to try new things and be open to experimenting and seeing for yourself what you like, and don’t forget to make some good memories while doing so! \uD83D\uDE0A"

      "content": "So you’ve finally made it to the number 1 university of Pakistan, after months and months of hard work and dedication. Congratulations! But what now? What kind of education system is used in university? After more than a decade of the yearly system and 4 years of Board Exams/CIEs, let me introduce you to the Semester and Relative Grading System. This shift in the system and exam grading is something many students struggle with soon after starting university. You might ask, what is the semester system? University degrees are generally of 4 years (except Bachelor of Architecture, which is of 5 years), comprising of 8-10 semesters, each semester is 16-18 weeks long. In most schools of NUST, internal examinations include multiple small 10-minute quizzes and One Hour Tests (OHTs), which take place twice in each semester. They take place in Week 6 and Week 12, with the End Semester Examinations (ESEs) taking place in the last week of the semester. For SADA, S3H, and NBS, they have mids in Week 9. In the semester system, the course is a lot and time is scarce, hence teachers teach faster than you’re previously used to. Listen attentively in class and take clear and concise notes. Try to retain as much information as you can and at the end of the week try and go over whatever you did the previous week to gear up for the next week. One very important tip is to not leave everything for the very end, as the course is generally in a decent quantity and time between exams is little to none. Ending this on the golden rule of the semester system – Study smart, not hard! Coming to the grading scheme, most schools in NUST employ Relative Grading schemes. In this, all students are graded relative to the class average. So gone are the days of scoring high and getting grades out of the total, it all depends on the class average and how well you perfume relative to the rest of the class, hence the name relative grading. But enough of studying and grades and all, remember to enjoy as contrary to popular belief, a good GPA can lend you a job but only skills can let you keep it!"
